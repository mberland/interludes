Unfortunately, there's no easy way to explain linear regression without a lot more information – indeed, this is one of those situations in which a little knowledge is more dangerous than none (**CITE**). That said, people use linear regression every single day across thousands of professions. A linear regression is, per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), an approach for modeling the relationship between two variables.
