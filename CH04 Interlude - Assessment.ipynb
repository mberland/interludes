Below, we offer actual, runnable Python code (targeted at programming novices) that implements an adaptive assessment for a grade school mathematics student. The way to wade through this code--regardless of your programming proficiency--is to notice how basic, core decisions (that a programmer might not even consider!) will generate inequitable outcomes for students. Assessment inequity does not require malevolence - almost everyone who is in education means well. \n","While building an adaptive assessment may sound complicated, it does not need to be. It is our hope that even non-programmers will be able to read the program code below and see points at which good intentions generate problematic situations. Berland teaches a class on computational research in education: an adaptive assessment like the ones below can be built by a relatively novice student for a week’s homework. Like everything in the book, building an assessment in which bias is exposed and which leverages or at least considers notions of equity in the structure of the assessment is not necessarily harder.\n","Let’s say you start with a simple math problem. In Canvas, a system used in classes at both Stanford and UW–Madison, instructors with no programming background can create a problem generator.

We have created an adaptive assessment. The more problems that a student gets right, the harder the following problems become, and the teacher gets a “max difficulty” score. Not only that, since the tool doesn’t penalize you for getting a question wrong (instead making the next question is relatively easier), you are incentivized to try to keep going and not worry about working on problems that may be a bit too hard. Sounds good, right? So what is wrong with this?\n","\n","The biggest problem is that very few problems scale in the way this generator is designed. The problems that do rarely assess understanding meaningfully. For that we need “features.”\n","\n","As we saw in many of the cases in the chapter, the decision of what counts as a “feature” (e.g. a measurable aspect, an axis, a column, a dimension) is extremely fraught.

Much of the feature engineering on massively successful machine learning in the marketplace is done by novices and interns.

This short code segment masks the equity implications of the scaling: different students will excel at different trajectories through these problems. For some students, addition of negative numbers will halt their progress through them, for others it may be the multiplication of multidigit numbers. It may be the case that there is a systematicity to these different trajectories. Considering the ways these would play out in the real world, it is  incumbent on programmers to account for different trajectories. \n","Teachers use tools everyday that carry these kinds of assumptions, and, because they might be implicit in simple code (e.g. like the code above), they go unexamined. It's not even clear that anyone involved with many of the systems would be aware of the need to look for systematic problems of the sort. Raising awareness that even simple code like this contains inherent systematic inequity (often residing in the IH quadrant of AnSpec) is not enough. \n","One possible best practice could be to agree that adaptive software offer some way to expose assumptions. While it doesn’t “fix” the inequality baked into an assessment, it at least makes such work obvious. Unfortunately, this either requires the user (in this case, teachers who already have plenty of other demands on their schedules) to dedicate their time to learning how to do critical analysis of code, or we need to create some sort of language for exposing and expressing these biases in ways that do not require teachers to go and get another Master's degree. \n","Turning the code above into an assessment only requires keeping track of the assessment implicit in the adaptivity:\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fygZkUV8tbLx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","def analyze_incorrect(user_answer, x1, x2, op_function):\n","   possible_operations = [lambda x,y: x+y,\n","                          lambda x,y: x-y,\n","                          lambda x,y: x*y]\n","   correct_answer = op_function(x1,x2)\n","   # if they simply flipped the order or used another operation\n","   # lower the difficulty of the operation\n","   if user_answer in map(lambda op: op(x1,x2), possible_operations) or user_answer in map(lambda op: op(x2,x1), possible_operations):\n","       print(\"are you sure you did the right operation?\")\n","       return (0,-1) \n","   # don't change range, make operation less difficult\n","   # or if they were within 10% of the correct answer\n","   # then change the range, but don’t change the operation\n","   elif abs(user_answer - correct_answer) <= abs(0.1 * correct_answer):\n","       print(\"are you sure you did the calculation correctly?\")\n","       return (-1,0)\n","   # otherwise, no guesses! difficulty for both is lowered by one\n","   else:\n","       return (-1,-1)\n"," \n","difficulty_range = 3\n","difficulty_operation = 3\n","max_range_difficulty = 0\n","max_operation_difficulty = 0\n"," \n","for i in range(5):\n","   x = addend(difficulty_range)\n","   y = addend(difficulty_range)\n","   op_name,op_function = arithmetic_operation(difficulty_operation)\n","   response = int(input('\\n{} {} {} = ?\\n'.format(x,op_name,y)))\n","   if response == op_function(x,y):\n","       difficulty_range += 1\n","       difficulty_operation += 1\n","       print(\"correct\")\n","   else:\n","       delta_difficulty_range, delta_difficulty_operation = analyze_incorrect(response,x,y,op_function)\n","       difficulty_range += delta_difficulty_range\n","       difficulty_operation -= delta_difficulty_operation\n","       print(\"incorrect\")\n","   print(\"range difficulty is now {}.\".format(difficulty_range))\n","   print(\"operation difficulty is now {}.\".format(difficulty_operation))\n","   max_range_difficulty = max(max_range_difficulty,difficulty_range)\n","   max_operation_difficulty = max(max_operation_difficulty,difficulty_operation)\n","print(\"user score (max range difficulty): {}\".format(max_range_difficulty))\n","print(\"user score (max operation difficulty): {}\".format(max_operation_difficulty))\n"," \n","# ** a sample run **\n","# python> 24 - 3 = ?\n","# user> 21\n","# python> correct\n","# python> range difficulty is now 4.\n","# python> operation difficulty is now 4.\n","#\n","# python> 32 - 20 = ?\n","# user> 12\n","# python> correct\n","# python> range difficulty is now 5.\n","# python> operation difficulty is now 5.\n","#\n","# python> 25 * 35 = ?\n","# user> 875\n","# python> correct\n","# python> range difficulty is now 6.\n","# python> operation difficulty is now 6.\n","#\n","# python> 0 * 48 = ?\n","# user> 0\n","# python> correct\n","# python> range difficulty is now 7.\n","# python> operation difficulty is now 7.\n","#\n","# python> 21 * 21 = ?\n","# user> 2\n","# python> incorrect\n","# python> range difficulty is now 6.\n","# python> operation difficulty is now 8.\n","# python> user score (max range difficulty): 7\n","# python> user score (max operation difficulty): 8\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Bfj4mcW4tc8A","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652802804950,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4653,"user":{"displayName":"matthew berland","userId":"00278639104689939753"}},"outputId":"edde72ef-4c56-48b8-9faa-5a317ba04575"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","21 - 3 = ?\n","0\n","incorrect\n","range difficulty is now 2.\n","operation difficulty is now 4.\n","\n","12 - 16 = ?\n","0\n","incorrect\n","range difficulty is now 1.\n","operation difficulty is now 5.\n","\n","9 * 1 = ?\n","0\n","incorrect\n","range difficulty is now 0.\n","operation difficulty is now 6.\n","\n","0 * 0 = ?\n","0\n","correct\n","range difficulty is now 1.\n","operation difficulty is now 7.\n","\n","3 * 9 = ?\n","0\n","incorrect\n","range difficulty is now 0.\n","operation difficulty is now 8.\n","user score (max range difficulty): 2\n","user score (max operation difficulty): 8\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","We can see how quickly our adaptive math tutor elides into a sort of de facto (if not de jure) assessment.
